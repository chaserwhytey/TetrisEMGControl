For this project, we used Matlab Tetris code taken from Mathworks website: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34513-matlabtetris by Matt Fig
We created a manual decoder that takes the ratio of EMG data from two muscle groups in the forearm in order to control movements. Flexion of the forearm will move the Tetris piece to the right, extension to the left, and flexing both muscle groups will rotate the piece. A Neuron SpikerBox Pro from Backyard Brains was used to record the EMG data with four electrodes, two for each channel. Neural data was normalized on an amplitude scale from 0 to 10 to allow hard-coded ratios to be used for decoding. We experimented with several ratios until we achieved optimal performance. Using a manual decoder, while difficult given the noisy nature of neural signals, allowed us to control the piece with less delay so that a fast-paced game could be played.
